      "185, eh/processed_videos/n8VCzsv5gi4_1_128.mp4 BUT DRAWBACK IS THAT AS THE PREVIOUS EXAMPLE SHOWS SO IF THE ORIGINAL PACKET IS LARGE\n",
      "186, eh/processed_videos/HRw1ORc7Hz0_4_33.mp4  SO ONCE YOU DO THIS SOMEONE CAN REPLICATE THE FABRICATION PROCESS AND CAN CLONE A CHIP SO YOU CAN STEAL THE DESIGN OF A CHIP AND YOU CAN\n",

      "226, eh/processed_videos/jLj7Xa7hYqU_3_87.mp4  WELL IT ALSO TAKES INTO ACCOUNT FLOW CONTROL THAT MEANS IF THERE IS A SPEED MISMATCH IT CAN SLOW DOWN OR MAKE IT FASTER THE RATE OF DATA TRANSFER IF THERE IS SOME ERRORS IT WILL TRY TO HANDLE ERROR IT WILL TRY TO RETRANSMIT THAT FRAME AGAIN AND SO ON\n",
      "227, eh/processed_videos/d68lt1-EZzI_1_105.mp4 FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF THE TESTER THE BEST THING IS WHITE BOX MODEL WHERE THE COMPANY\n",

      "900, eh/processed_videos/NgVD3tJN_44_2_47.mp4  NOW LET US TALK ABOUT ANOTHER APPLICATION OF PUBLIC KEY CRYPTOGRAPHY NAMELY AUTHENTICATION\n",
      "901, eh/processed_videos/jLj7Xa7hYqU_3_25.mp4  THIS NODE WILL BE SENDING SOME PACKETS TO THE NEXT NODE AND WILL BE EXPECTING SOME ACKNOWLEDGEMENT TO COME THAT WELL I HAVE RECEIVED THE PACKETS CORRECTLY\n",
      "902, eh/processed_videos/5kw-999agbo_4_71.mp4  THEY ALL SATISFY THE PROPERTIES I HAVE MENTIONED DESIRABLE PROPERTIES AND BROADLY SPEAKING THEY CAN BE CLASSIFIED INTO SOME FAMILIES\n",
      "903, eh/processed_videos/ifiFTkyrUIA_4_60.mp4 THERE WAS NO APPARENT WEAKNESS IN THE ALGORITHM THE ONLY CONCERN WAS THE KEY SIZE WAS SMALLER AND MANY THEORETICAL ATTACKS\n",
      "904, eh/processed_videos/WNhBey5hDk4_2_5.mp4 ONE IS CALLED VARIABLE LENGTH SUBNET MASK OR VLSM OTHER IS CLASSLESS INTERNET DOMAIN ROUTING OR CIDR OK\n",
      "905, eh/processed_videos/7sgoPJ2MDdA_2_54.mp4  SO IN CIRCUIT SWITCHING BECAUSE WE HAVE A PATH TO BE ESTABLISHED BETWEEN THE SEND AND RECEIVER BEFORE YOU CAN ACTUALLY START THE COMMUNICATION\n",
      "906, eh/processed_videos/Wnygf2DjHIg_2_4.mp4 SUPPOSE AS A HUMAN BEING MY FINGERPRINT IS SOMETHING WHICH IS SUPPOSED TO IDENTIFY ME MY FINGERPRINT IS SUPPOSED TO BE UNIQUE SO IN THE SAME WAY WHENEVER I DESIGN SOME HARDWARE CIRCUIT AN IC CHIP\n",
      "907, eh/processed_videos/NgVD3tJN_44_2_139.mp4 BUT THE TROUBLE IS THAT THIS PUBLIC KEY ALGORITHM LIKE RSA IS VERY SLOW AS COMPARED TO DES OR AES\n",
      "908, eh/processed_videos/fJVDE9D8PKQ_2_16.mp4  GENERIC MODEL IS LIKE THIS WE ARE ASSUMING THAT WE HAVE SOMETHING LIKE A NETWORKING INFRASTRUCTURE WHERE THERE IS A SOURCE THERE IS A DESTINATION SOURCE IS TRYING TO SEND SOME MESSAGE TO A DESTINATION\n",
      "909, eh/processed_videos/xMubwlXSJf8_2_36.mp4  AND DURING THAT PERIOD WHEN THE SHORT TERM KEY IS ACTIVE THE DATA WHICH ARE TRANSMITTED AND FLOWS THROUGH THE CONNECTION WILL BE ENCRYPTED USING THE SHORT TERM KEY RIGHT\n",

      "912, eh/processed_videos/NgVD3tJN_44_2_154.mp4  SO SUCH THINGS WILL BECOME YOU SEE SOME OF THE COMPANIES ARE ALREADY COME UP WITH SOME PROTECTION AGAINST THIS KIND OF QUANTUM ATTACKS\n",

      "918, eh/processed_videos/Wnygf2DjHIg_4_59.mp4 LET US ASSUME THAT THE NAND GATE THAT I WAS TALKING ABOUT THAT NAND GATE I CAN POTENTIALLY PLACE IN ANY OF THE GRIDS\n",

      "922, eh/processed_videos/jB_dXbOKppI_1_47.mp4  AND THERE IS A INTRUDER WHO HAS BEEN LOOKING AT THE MESSAGE EXCHANGES AND HAVE UNDERSTOOD WHAT KIND OF MESSAGE EXCHANGES ARE GOING ON\n",

      "928, eh/processed_videos/br9RRwA918U_2_128.mp4  THE CLIENT WILL SEND A PACKET WITH THE SYN FLAG SET\n",
      "929, eh/processed_videos/jLj7Xa7hYqU_3_38.mp4  SO HERE HOW MUCH TIME WILL IT TAKE\n",
      "930, eh/processed_videos/7Cc8HDdet9c_1_17.mp4 YOU SEE THE FIRST TWO ENTRIES REFER TO NETWORK ADDRESS IT STARTS IT ENDS WITH DOT 0 BUT THE LAST ONE IS A HOST SPECIFIC ADDRESS BECAUSE IT IS A HOST SPECIFIC ADDRESS I AM USING ALL BITS\n",
      "931, eh/processed_videos/NgVD3tJN_44_2_133.mp4  THEY ARE OF THE ORDER OF 1024 TO 2048 EVEN MORE NUMBER OF BITS\n",
      "932, eh/processed_videos/8F9qa4z4sHs_1_93.mp4  THAT IS REFERRED TO AS A LOOPBACK OR A LOCAL ADDRESS\n",
      "933, eh/processed_videos/jB_dXbOKppI_1_53.mp4 SO INTRUDER HAS THE VALUE OF X B DOES NOT KNOW THAT B IS SENDING A SIMILAR PACKET TO A WHICH THE INTRUDER IS ALSO CAPTURING\n",
      "934, eh/processed_videos/br9RRwA918U_2_125.mp4 THERE IS SOMETHING CALLED A THREE WAY HANDSHAKE PROTOCOL WHICH IS FOLLOWED HERE\n",
      "935, eh/processed_videos/U0Jts2z9MOc_4_125.mp4 IF SOMEONE IS SPOOFING THE ROUTER CAN IMMEDIATELY DETECT IF IT IS CONFIGURED THAT WAY\n",
      "936, eh/processed_videos/8F9qa4z4sHs_1_38.mp4  AND NOW WHEN THE ROUTERS FORWARD OR ROUTE THE PACKETS THEY DO NOT LOOK AT THE HOST PART THEY WILL ONLY LOOK AT THE NETWORK NUMBER PART\n",
      "937, eh/processed_videos/lcGVMOUVJ3E_3_92.mp4 THEN NETWORK SPECIFIC ROUTING I SAID SOMETIMES I SPECIFY THE ADDRESS OF A NETWORK AS A DESTINATION RATHER THAN A SORRY RATHER THAN A HOST\n",
      "938, eh/processed_videos/jB_dXbOKppI_1_8.mp4 SO HERE THE IDEA IS THAT TWO PARTIES TWO PARTIES CAN EXCHANGE A SET OF MESSAGES\n",
      "939, eh/processed_videos/QhTuW5M2t6c_3_52.mp4 SO IF THE MESSENGER GETS CAPTURED THEN THE PAPER WILL ALSO BE SEEN\n",
      "940, eh/processed_videos/n8VCzsv5gi4_1_40.mp4 SO I AM SHOWING ONE OF THE PATH SHOWN BY THIS RED DOTTED LINE WHERE IT WILL FIRST BE COMING TO THIS R THEN THIS ROUTER TO THE N 2 THROUGH N 2 IT WILL CROSS THEN IT WILL ENTER THIS AND FINALLY IT WILL REACH THE FINAL NETWORK\n",
      "941, eh/processed_videos/mm4fzI5ejUE_1_4.mp4 YOU SEE NEWS IN EVERY ALTERNATE DAY THAT VARIOUS ATTEMPTS\n",
      "942, eh/processed_videos/VBaP0bzrgck_4_80.mp4  AT HIS OR HER DISPOSAL THEN THIS KIND OF ATTACK CAN BE MOUNTED AND AS I SAID SECURE SIDE CHANNEL ATTACK RESISTANT IMPLEMENTATIONS BECOME THE ORDER OF THE DAY BECOMES VERY IMPORTANT OK\n",
      "943, eh/processed_videos/lcGVMOUVJ3E_3_49.mp4  AND THE OTHER CAN BE HOST TO ROUTER OR ROUTER TO HOST THERE CAN BE ONE OR MORE ROUTERS ONE I HAVE SHOWN THERE CAN BE MORE ROUTERS CONNECTED THERE CAN BE OTHER ROUTERS ALSO CONNECTED FOR EXAMPLE THERE IS ANOTHER ROUTER HERE\n",
      "944, eh/processed_videos/9hAZ5LSdQik_1_104.mp4  SO CLIENT SENDS A HELLO MESSAGE\n",

      "946, eh/processed_videos/X8F1Ex6bUeU_6_134.mp4 SO MANY BYTES OF DATA WILL FINALLY GET TRANSMITTED BUT ULTIMATELY I WAS TRYING TO TRANSMIT ONLY 200 BYTES\n",
      "947, eh/processed_videos/oYjbOF5QcZ8_4_61.mp4 MEANS WITH EVERY PASSING DAY YOU CAN SAY SO IF YOU CANNOT SECURE THESE KIND OF DEVICES IN A VERY GOOD WAY THEN IT WILL BE VERY EASY FOR SOMEONE SOME ATTACKER TO PENETRATE INTO THAT KIND OF A SYSTEM RIGHT SO\n",
      "948, eh/processed_videos/37BFoKpn4xg_2_51.mp4 SO THIS IS PICTORIALLY WHAT I HAVE JUST NOW MENTIONED\n",
      "949, eh/processed_videos/cHG1a5-xX9A_2_69.mp4  HERE AN ACTIVE PARTICIPATION OF THE SIGNER IS NECESSARY DURING SIGNATURE VERIFICATION\n",
      "950, eh/processed_videos/m582hVNdFFk_2_67.mp4 THERE ARE JUST TWO ADDITIONAL THINGS WHICH ARE THERE IN UDP WHICH IP DOES NOT HAVE AT THE TRANSPORT LAYER LEVEL IT INCORPORATES A CHECKSUM TO VERIFY WHETHER THE UDP PACKET\n",
      "951, eh/processed_videos/n8VCzsv5gi4_1_153.mp4 SO INSTEAD OF SPECIFYING THIS AS A 16 BIT FIELD BECAUSE THE NUMBER OF BITS IN THE HEADER IS LIMITED IT USES A 13 BIT FIELD AND PUTS A RESTRICTION THAT OFFSET HAS TO BE A MULTIPLE OF 8 BITS OK\n",
      "952, eh/processed_videos/7sgoPJ2MDdA_2_94.mp4 SO I CAN COLLECT MY PACKETS AT A FASTER RATE STORE IN A BUFFER AND THEN SLOWLY AND SLOWLY I WILL SEND IT TO THE OUTGOING LINK WHICH HAS A SLOWER DATA RATE\n",
      "953, eh/processed_videos/lcGVMOUVJ3E_2_13.mp4  TCP IS CONNECTION ORIENTED UDP IS CONNECTION LESS\n",
      "954, eh/processed_videos/-tfNAI_PwwQ_1_112.mp4 NOW ABSENCE OF HELLO PACKET FOR CERTAIN TIME FOR 40 SECONDS OR SO THIS MAY LEAD THE ROUTER TO TAKE A DECISION OR A CONCLUSION THAT WELL THAT LINK IS CURRENTLY DOWN THAT OTHER ROUTER HAS FAILED OK\n",
      "955, eh/processed_videos/m582hVNdFFk_2_92.mp4 THIS IS HOW IT WORKS\n",
      "956, eh/processed_videos/U0Jts2z9MOc_2_37.mp4  AND ON BEHALF OF THE ATTACKER ALL THESE BOTNETS ARE WORKING\n",
      "957, eh/processed_videos/NgVD3tJN_44_2_138.mp4  BECAUSE YOU YOU CAN TAKE THE PUBLIC KEY OF THE OTHER PARTY WHEREVER HE IS ENCRYPT IT AND SEND IT TO THAT PERSON THAT PERSON CAN DECRYPT IT USING HIS OR HER OWN PRIVATE KEY\n",
      "958, eh/processed_videos/xMubwlXSJf8_2_42.mp4 THERE IS A SECOND MECHANISM YOU CAN HAVE RSA BASED AUTHENTICATION USING YOUR PRIVATE KEY OR THERE IS SOME SOMETHING CALLED A CHALLENGE RESPONSE\n",
      "959, eh/processed_videos/QhTuW5M2t6c_3_141.mp4 SO HERE WE TALK ABOUT THAT\n",
      "960, eh/processed_videos/lcGVMOUVJ3E_3_112.mp4 SO IT DOES NOT KNOW WHERE IT IS\n",
      "961, eh/processed_videos/X8F1Ex6bUeU_4_100.mp4 IT JUST PROVIDES A TRANSPORT LAYER INTERFACE TO DIRECTLY INTERFACE WITH IP\n",
      "962, eh/processed_videos/d68lt1-EZzI_1_76.mp4  BACKDOORS ARE SOME YOU CAN SAY ENTRY POINTS TO A SYSTEM WHICH ARE DELIBERATELY KEPT BY THE DEVELOPERS\n",
      "963, eh/processed_videos/58V4Wo7lxwc_2_23.mp4 NOW IF WE CONSIDER THE PACKETS THAT CORRESPOND TO A VIDEO STREAM THE PACKETS ARE FOLLOWING ONE PATH SUDDENLY THE PACKETS START FOLLOWING ANOTHER PATH WHICH IS A LONGER PATH THE DELAY WILL INCREASE OK\n",
      "964, eh/processed_videos/Wnygf2DjHIg_3_18.mp4 FIRST IS IT SHOULD BE SOMETHING WHICH SHOULD NOT BE TOO DIFFICULT TO EVALUATE IN TERMS OF THE CHALLENGE RESPONSE\n",
      "965, eh/processed_videos/jB_dXbOKppI_1_81.mp4 THE RECEIVING END RECEIVES THIS WHOLE THING\n",

      "967, eh/processed_videos/M8DWk0mJQDY_2_41.mp4  THESE TWO METHODS LOOK VERY FINE BUT THE ONLY DOWNSIDE IS THAT I AM HAVING TO USE ENCRYPTION AND DECRYPTION ALGORITHMS AT THE TWO ENDS AND AS I SAID ENCRYPTION AND DECRYPTION ARE SLOWER AS COMPARED TO HASH FUNCTION COMPUTATION\n",
      "968, eh/processed_videos/7sgoPJ2MDdA_2_57.mp4 THIS IS REQUIRED BEFORE THE DATA TRANSMISSION CAN START AND ONCE YOU HAVE THE CONNECTION\n",
      "969, eh/processed_videos/CspyUy_ncuM_3_77.mp4  AND HERE LASTLY FOR ERROR CHECKING THERE IS A FIELD WHICH IS THERE WHICH IS CALLED WHICH IS CALLED HEADER CHECKSUM\n",
      "970, eh/processed_videos/xMubwlXSJf8_1_3.mp4 AND SECURE HTTP OK\n",
      "971, eh/processed_videos/fJVDE9D8PKQ_2_14.mp4 BROADLY SPEAKING FOUR KIND OF ATTACKS YOU CAN IDENTIFY OR YOU CAN TALK ABOUT INTERRUPTION INTERCEPTION MODIFICATION AND FABRICATION\n",

      "973, eh/processed_videos/xMubwlXSJf8_2_95.mp4  AND AND THE OTHER ONE ALSO ON THE HEADER PART BECAUSE YOU SEE THIS HEADER PART IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE SAY IF I AM THE INTRUDER AND I AM ABLE TO HACK INTO SOME ROUTER SO THAT I CAN CHANGE THE HEADERS\n",
      "974, eh/processed_videos/lcGVMOUVJ3E_3_88.mp4  AND IN THE ROUTING TABLE OF R 1 THERE WILL BE SOMETHING LIKE THIS IT SAYS AGAIN IF THE DESTINATION IS H 2 THEN I HAVE TO GO TO R 2\n",
      "975, eh/processed_videos/5kw-999agbo_1_8.mp4  IN THE PRESENT CONTEXT HOW WE VISUALIZE A HASH FUNCTION AS OKAY WELL WE VISUALIZE A HASH FUNCTION AS AS SOME KIND OF COMPUTATIONAL FUNCTION THAT CAN DETERMINE A HASH DIGEST H\n",
      "976, eh/processed_videos/oYjbOF5QcZ8_3_41.mp4  IN CMOS ALSO THERE ARE VARIOUS DESIGN STYLES DYNAMIC UNDER DYNAMIC ALSO THERE ARE SEVERAL TIMES STATIC\n",
      "977, eh/processed_videos/fJVDE9D8PKQ_5_118.mp4 SO TO GET BACK I MEAN ANY MEANINGFUL INFORMATION YOU WILL HAVE TO DECODE THAT INFORMATION SOMEHOW THAT IS CALLED CRYPTO ANALYSIS WHICH IS EXTREMELY DIFFICULT\n",
      "978, eh/processed_videos/Wnygf2DjHIg_4_43.mp4  SO THIS OUTPUT Y WHETHER IT WILL FINALLY BECOME 1 OR 0 IT DEPENDS ON THE RELATIVE DELAYS OF THE TWO GATES WHICH WE CANNOT PREDICT BEFOREHAND\n",
      "979, eh/processed_videos/U0Jts2z9MOc_3_58.mp4  THE ATTACK IS MOUNTED BY OTHER MACHINES THE ORIGINAL ATTACKER MAY NOT BE IN THE PICTURE AT ALL WHEN THE ATTACK IS BEING MOUNTED OK\n",
