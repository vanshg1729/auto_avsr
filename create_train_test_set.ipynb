      "854, eh/processed_videos/CspyUy_ncuM_3_71.mp4  AND OF COURSE WE TALKED ABOUT THE VARIABLE WITH OPTIONS HEADER YOU CAN HAVE SOME ADDITIONAL YOU CAN HAVE SOME ADDITIONAL HEADER FIELDS YOU CAN ADD\n",
      "855, eh/processed_videos/WNhBey5hDk4_3_132.mp4  OK THIS NUMBER M SLASH SOMETHING THIS I CAN USE ANYTHING IN A FLEXIBLE WAY DEPENDING ON THE SIZE OF MY ORGANIZATION SIZE OF MY NETWORK I CAN DO ANY ARBITRARY PARTITIONING THIS IS THE ADVANTAGE OF CIDR\n",

      "857, eh/processed_videos/7sgoPJ2MDdA_2_35.mp4  BUT IN CONTRAST A LOCAL ARRAY NETWORK IS SOMETHING WHICH IS YOUR OWN YOU ARE BUYING THE EQUIPMENTS YOU ARE BUYING THE CABLES AND THE ENTIRE MANAGEMENT THE ENTIRE INFRASTRUCTURE IS YOUR OWN\n",
      "858, eh/processed_videos/58V4Wo7lxwc_2_64.mp4 SO YOU SEE THIS IS A SLIGHT DEVIATION FROM THE CONNECTIONLESS APPROACH THAT IP VERSION 6 ALSO SUPPORTS\n",
      "859, eh/processed_videos/8F9qa4z4sHs_1_16.mp4 NOW WE SHALL SEE THAT THIS 32 BIT NETWORK ADDRESS THAT WE ARE TALKING ABOUT THERE ARE TWO PARTS IN THIS ADDRESS\n",
      "860, eh/processed_videos/WNhBey5hDk4_2_18.mp4  CLASS A B OR C IN ITS PUREST FORM THERE ARE NO SUB NETWORKS THAT IS WHAT IS MEANT BY NATURAL NATURAL MASK\n",
      "861, eh/processed_videos/n8VCzsv5gi4_1_23.mp4 SO WHAT WILL HAPPEN\n",
      "862, eh/processed_videos/ifiFTkyrUIA_5_111.mp4  IN THE NEXT LECTURE WE SHALL BE STARTING SOME DISCUSSION ON PUBLIC KEY CRYPTOSYSTEMS AND WHAT ARE THE METHODS THAT CAN BE USED THERE\n",
      "863, eh/processed_videos/n8VCzsv5gi4_1_10.mp4 THIS IS THE BASIC IDEA BEHIND FRAGMENTATION\n",
      "864, eh/processed_videos/m582hVNdFFk_2_95.mp4 LIKE YOU THINK OF YOUR MAIL SMTP SMTP WILL BE HAVING SOME PARTICULAR PORT NUMBER YOU THINK OF SOME NETWORK APPLICATION LIKE TELNET\n",
      "865, eh/processed_videos/-tfNAI_PwwQ_1_115.mp4 LET THE OTHERS ALSO KNOW\n",
      "866, eh/processed_videos/WNhBey5hDk4_2_45.mp4  LIKE FOR EXAMPLE IN A CLASS C NETWORK I CAN HAVE 254 HOSTS IN A NETWORK\n",
      "867, eh/processed_videos/NgVD3tJN_44_2_121.mp4  SO THE ONE OF SUCH VALUE OF E YOU CAN TAKE AS 5 5 IS ONE SUCH VALUE YOU CAN VERIFY 5 AND 96 ARE RELATIVELY PRIME THE GCD IS 1\n",
      "868, eh/processed_videos/xMubwlXSJf8_2_67.mp4  THE INTRUDER CAN HEAR OR LISTEN TO A SEQUENCE OF MESSAGES OR PACKETS THAT ARE FLOWING THROUGH THE NETWORK WHEN SOME LEGITIMATE USER IS ACCESSING SOME SERVICE\n",
      "869, eh/processed_videos/WNhBey5hDk4_3_148.mp4 SO THE STARTING ADDRESS WILL BE THIS THE ENDING ADDRESS WILL BE THIS\n",
      "870, eh/processed_videos/7Cc8HDdet9c_7_171.mp4 AND FINALLY M2 IS THE DEFAULT WHICH WILL BE SENDING IT TO THE EXTERNAL ROUTER\n",
      "871, eh/processed_videos/37BFoKpn4xg_0_0.mp4 AH IN THIS LECTURE WE SHALL BE TALKING ABOUT\n",
      "872, eh/processed_videos/n8VCzsv5gi4_1_77.mp4  EVEN IF THERE ARE MULTIPLE EXIT ROUTERS ALL THE FRAGMENTS WILL HAVE TO GO TO THE SAME ROUTER FOR HANDLING\n",
      "873, eh/processed_videos/nBLAgd-oWNQ_1_39.mp4 SO LIKE THIS K 3 K 4 K 5 FOR EVERY PAIR OF SEND AND RECEIVER THERE WILL BE A DIFFERENT VALUE OF SECRET KEY\n",
      "874, eh/processed_videos/7sgoPJ2MDdA_2_21.mp4 NOW THIS RELATIVELY SMALL IS A REALLY A RELATIVE TERM IT CAN BE IN THE SAME ROOM IT CAN BE IN THE SAME BUILDING OR MAYBE WITHIN THE SAME CAMPUS\n",
      "875, eh/processed_videos/Wnygf2DjHIg_4_38.mp4  THIS GATE FASTER MEANS WHEN THIS IS 1 SO BOTH THE INPUTS ARE 1 AND 1 1 AND 1 NAND OUTPUT IS 0\n",
      "876, eh/processed_videos/8F9qa4z4sHs_1_53.mp4 THERE CAN BE 127 CLASS A NETWORKS AND INSIDE EACH SUCH NETWORK THERE ARE 24 BITS IN THE HOST PART\n",
      "877, eh/processed_videos/QhTuW5M2t6c_3_127.mp4 SO I USE 1000 OF THESE PIXEL BYTES I PUT THIS 1000 BITS IN THE LEAST SIGNIFICANT BIT POSITIONS\n",
      "878, eh/processed_videos/37BFoKpn4xg_2_132.mp4 THE ATTACKER IN CAN INITIATE THOUSANDS OF CONNECTION FROM FORGED IP ADDRESSES SPOOFED IP ADDRESSES AND MOUNT THIS KIND OF AN ATTACK\n",
      "879, eh/processed_videos/lcGVMOUVJ3E_4_134.mp4 SO I MENTIONED EARLIER THAT TO GET THE NETWORK ADDRESS YOU WILL HAVE TO DO A BIT BY BIT AND OPERATION YOU WILL HAVE TO CARRY OUT A BIT WISE AND OPERATION\n",
      "880, eh/processed_videos/58V4Wo7lxwc_2_27.mp4  OF COURSE WITHIN THE HOST YOU FORCIBLY YOU USED A SUBNET AND INTRODUCED A THIRD THIRD HIERARCHY BUT THAT IS JUST WITHIN THE HOST ADDRESS SPACE AVAILABLE TO YOU\n",
      "881, eh/processed_videos/HRw1ORc7Hz0_4_54.mp4 THIS IS HOW WE MEANS AN ATTACKER CAN USE TROJANS TO DO SOMETHING MALICIOUS\n",
      "882, eh/processed_videos/VBaP0bzrgck_3_12.mp4 SO WHILE THIS BOARD IS CARRYING OUT SOME OPERATION I AM OBSERVING WHAT IS GOING ON\n",
      "883, eh/processed_videos/QhTuW5M2t6c_3_85.mp4 THAT WILL DEFINE THE SIZE OF MY IMAGE\n",
      "884, eh/processed_videos/d68lt1-EZzI_1_139.mp4 SO YOU NEED TO UNDERSTAND WHAT ARE THE THINGS THAT ARE POSSIBLE AND WHAT ARE NOT POSSIBLE\n",
      "885, eh/processed_videos/n8VCzsv5gi4_1_142.mp4  SO THE ID FIELD INDICATES THAT ALTHOUGH THEY ARE DIFFERENT FRAGMENTS DIFFERENT PACKETS BUT THEY ACTUALLY BELONG TO THE SAME MASTER PACKET THEY HAVE TO BE REASSEMBLED TOGETHER OK\n",
      "886, eh/processed_videos/m582hVNdFFk_2_13.mp4  NOW THIS DIAGRAM SHOWS WHAT I HAVE JUST NOW SAID DIAGRAMMATICALLY\n",
      "887, eh/processed_videos/m582hVNdFFk_2_39.mp4  POSITIVE ACKNOWLEDGEMENT THE RECEIVER SENDS BACK SOME ACKNOWLEDGEMENT TO THE SENDER THAT WELL I HAVE RECEIVED ALL BYTES UP TO 1050 THIS IS A POSITIVE ACKNOWLEDGEMENT\n",
      "888, eh/processed_videos/7sgoPJ2MDdA_2_24.mp4 IT STARTED WITH A VERY PRIMITIVE FORM THE 10 MEGAHERTZ MBPS MEGABITS PER SECOND ETHERNET\n",

      "891, eh/processed_videos/m582hVNdFFk_2_14.mp4 SO THIS IS WHERE WE ARE AT THE TRANSPORT LAYER LEVEL\n",
      "892, eh/processed_videos/WNhBey5hDk4_3_143.mp4  SO LET US TAKE A VERY SPECIFIC EXAMPLE SUPPOSE AN ORGANIZATION IS ASSIGNED A CIDR NETWORK LIKE THIS\n",

      "900, eh/processed_videos/NgVD3tJN_44_2_47.mp4  NOW LET US TALK ABOUT ANOTHER APPLICATION OF PUBLIC KEY CRYPTOGRAPHY NAMELY AUTHENTICATION\n",
      "901, eh/processed_videos/jLj7Xa7hYqU_3_25.mp4  THIS NODE WILL BE SENDING SOME PACKETS TO THE NEXT NODE AND WILL BE EXPECTING SOME ACKNOWLEDGEMENT TO COME THAT WELL I HAVE RECEIVED THE PACKETS CORRECTLY\n",
      "902, eh/processed_videos/5kw-999agbo_4_71.mp4  THEY ALL SATISFY THE PROPERTIES I HAVE MENTIONED DESIRABLE PROPERTIES AND BROADLY SPEAKING THEY CAN BE CLASSIFIED INTO SOME FAMILIES\n",
      "903, eh/processed_videos/ifiFTkyrUIA_4_60.mp4 THERE WAS NO APPARENT WEAKNESS IN THE ALGORITHM THE ONLY CONCERN WAS THE KEY SIZE WAS SMALLER AND MANY THEORETICAL ATTACKS\n",
      "904, eh/processed_videos/WNhBey5hDk4_2_5.mp4 ONE IS CALLED VARIABLE LENGTH SUBNET MASK OR VLSM OTHER IS CLASSLESS INTERNET DOMAIN ROUTING OR CIDR OK\n",
      "905, eh/processed_videos/7sgoPJ2MDdA_2_54.mp4  SO IN CIRCUIT SWITCHING BECAUSE WE HAVE A PATH TO BE ESTABLISHED BETWEEN THE SEND AND RECEIVER BEFORE YOU CAN ACTUALLY START THE COMMUNICATION\n",
      "906, eh/processed_videos/Wnygf2DjHIg_2_4.mp4 SUPPOSE AS A HUMAN BEING MY FINGERPRINT IS SOMETHING WHICH IS SUPPOSED TO IDENTIFY ME MY FINGERPRINT IS SUPPOSED TO BE UNIQUE SO IN THE SAME WAY WHENEVER I DESIGN SOME HARDWARE CIRCUIT AN IC CHIP\n",
      "907, eh/processed_videos/NgVD3tJN_44_2_139.mp4 BUT THE TROUBLE IS THAT THIS PUBLIC KEY ALGORITHM LIKE RSA IS VERY SLOW AS COMPARED TO DES OR AES\n",
      "908, eh/processed_videos/fJVDE9D8PKQ_2_16.mp4  GENERIC MODEL IS LIKE THIS WE ARE ASSUMING THAT WE HAVE SOMETHING LIKE A NETWORKING INFRASTRUCTURE WHERE THERE IS A SOURCE THERE IS A DESTINATION SOURCE IS TRYING TO SEND SOME MESSAGE TO A DESTINATION\n",
      "909, eh/processed_videos/xMubwlXSJf8_2_36.mp4  AND DURING THAT PERIOD WHEN THE SHORT TERM KEY IS ACTIVE THE DATA WHICH ARE TRANSMITTED AND FLOWS THROUGH THE CONNECTION WILL BE ENCRYPTED USING THE SHORT TERM KEY RIGHT\n",
      "910, eh/processed_videos/M8DWk0mJQDY_2_9.mp4  THERE ALSO THIS KIND OF ONE WAY HASH FUNCTIONS ARE USED\n",
      "911, eh/processed_videos/7sgoPJ2MDdA_1_16.mp4  AND OBVIOUSLY SHARING OF RESOURCES NOWADAYS WE TALK ABOUT CLOUD COMPUTING WHERE NOT ONLY STORAGE SPACE BUT ALSO COMPUTING RESOURCES ARE AVAILABLE ONLINE ON THE NETWORK ON THE CLOUD\n",
      "912, eh/processed_videos/NgVD3tJN_44_2_154.mp4  SO SUCH THINGS WILL BECOME YOU SEE SOME OF THE COMPANIES ARE ALREADY COME UP WITH SOME PROTECTION AGAINST THIS KIND OF QUANTUM ATTACKS\n",
      "913, eh/processed_videos/WNhBey5hDk4_3_104.mp4 SO LET US EXPLORE WHETHER ANY OF THESE CAN SATISFY OUR REQUIREMENT\n",
      "914, eh/processed_videos/U0Jts2z9MOc_2_50.mp4 SO THAT DATA IT WILL BE SENDING DIRECTED TO THE VICTIM MACHINE\n",
      "915, eh/processed_videos/QhTuW5M2t6c_3_160.mp4 INSIDE THIS PICTURE SOME OTHER PICTURE WAS HIDDEN\n",

      "917, eh/processed_videos/X8F1Ex6bUeU_4_54.mp4  SO THIS IS JUST A VERY QUICK PICTURE NOW TALKING ABOUT THESE FOUR I WILL VERY BRIEFLY TALK ABOUT THESE\n",
      "918, eh/processed_videos/Wnygf2DjHIg_4_59.mp4 LET US ASSUME THAT THE NAND GATE THAT I WAS TALKING ABOUT THAT NAND GATE I CAN POTENTIALLY PLACE IN ANY OF THE GRIDS\n",

      "921, eh/processed_videos/7Cc8HDdet9c_9_181.mp4 NOW IN THIS EXAMPLE THE FIRST ONE 24 THERE WILL BE THERE WILL BE A MATCH\n",
      "922, eh/processed_videos/jB_dXbOKppI_1_47.mp4  AND THERE IS A INTRUDER WHO HAS BEEN LOOKING AT THE MESSAGE EXCHANGES AND HAVE UNDERSTOOD WHAT KIND OF MESSAGE EXCHANGES ARE GOING ON\n",
      "923, eh/processed_videos/CspyUy_ncuM_3_44.mp4  NORMALLY FOR OUR NORMAL COMPUTERS WHICH WE USE THERE WE USE IP VERSION 4\n",
      "924, eh/processed_videos/fJVDE9D8PKQ_3_52.mp4 DESTINATION WILL FEEL THAT THE PACKET IS ACTUALLY COMING FROM S BUT WHICH IS NOT THE PACKET WAS COMING FROM THE INTRUDER\n",
      "925, eh/processed_videos/jB_dXbOKppI_1_60.mp4 SO THIS DIFFIE HELLMAN METHOD IS SUSCEPTIBLE TO MAN IN THE MIDDLE ATTACK\n",
      "926, eh/processed_videos/U0Jts2z9MOc_2_36.mp4 LARGE NUMBER OF BOTNETS ARE FIRING PACKETS TO THE VICTIM OK\n",

      "928, eh/processed_videos/br9RRwA918U_2_128.mp4  THE CLIENT WILL SEND A PACKET WITH THE SYN FLAG SET\n",
      "929, eh/processed_videos/jLj7Xa7hYqU_3_38.mp4  SO HERE HOW MUCH TIME WILL IT TAKE\n",
      "930, eh/processed_videos/7Cc8HDdet9c_1_17.mp4 YOU SEE THE FIRST TWO ENTRIES REFER TO NETWORK ADDRESS IT STARTS IT ENDS WITH DOT 0 BUT THE LAST ONE IS A HOST SPECIFIC ADDRESS BECAUSE IT IS A HOST SPECIFIC ADDRESS I AM USING ALL BITS\n",
      "931, eh/processed_videos/NgVD3tJN_44_2_133.mp4  THEY ARE OF THE ORDER OF 1024 TO 2048 EVEN MORE NUMBER OF BITS\n",
      "932, eh/processed_videos/8F9qa4z4sHs_1_93.mp4  THAT IS REFERRED TO AS A LOOPBACK OR A LOCAL ADDRESS\n",
      "933, eh/processed_videos/jB_dXbOKppI_1_53.mp4 SO INTRUDER HAS THE VALUE OF X B DOES NOT KNOW THAT B IS SENDING A SIMILAR PACKET TO A WHICH THE INTRUDER IS ALSO CAPTURING\n",
      "934, eh/processed_videos/br9RRwA918U_2_125.mp4 THERE IS SOMETHING CALLED A THREE WAY HANDSHAKE PROTOCOL WHICH IS FOLLOWED HERE\n",
      "935, eh/processed_videos/U0Jts2z9MOc_4_125.mp4 IF SOMEONE IS SPOOFING THE ROUTER CAN IMMEDIATELY DETECT IF IT IS CONFIGURED THAT WAY\n",
      "936, eh/processed_videos/8F9qa4z4sHs_1_38.mp4  AND NOW WHEN THE ROUTERS FORWARD OR ROUTE THE PACKETS THEY DO NOT LOOK AT THE HOST PART THEY WILL ONLY LOOK AT THE NETWORK NUMBER PART\n",
      "937, eh/processed_videos/lcGVMOUVJ3E_3_92.mp4 THEN NETWORK SPECIFIC ROUTING I SAID SOMETIMES I SPECIFY THE ADDRESS OF A NETWORK AS A DESTINATION RATHER THAN A SORRY RATHER THAN A HOST\n",
      "938, eh/processed_videos/jB_dXbOKppI_1_8.mp4 SO HERE THE IDEA IS THAT TWO PARTIES TWO PARTIES CAN EXCHANGE A SET OF MESSAGES\n",
      "939, eh/processed_videos/QhTuW5M2t6c_3_52.mp4 SO IF THE MESSENGER GETS CAPTURED THEN THE PAPER WILL ALSO BE SEEN\n",
      "940, eh/processed_videos/n8VCzsv5gi4_1_40.mp4 SO I AM SHOWING ONE OF THE PATH SHOWN BY THIS RED DOTTED LINE WHERE IT WILL FIRST BE COMING TO THIS R THEN THIS ROUTER TO THE N 2 THROUGH N 2 IT WILL CROSS THEN IT WILL ENTER THIS AND FINALLY IT WILL REACH THE FINAL NETWORK\n",
      "941, eh/processed_videos/mm4fzI5ejUE_1_4.mp4 YOU SEE NEWS IN EVERY ALTERNATE DAY THAT VARIOUS ATTEMPTS\n",
      "942, eh/processed_videos/VBaP0bzrgck_4_80.mp4  AT HIS OR HER DISPOSAL THEN THIS KIND OF ATTACK CAN BE MOUNTED AND AS I SAID SECURE SIDE CHANNEL ATTACK RESISTANT IMPLEMENTATIONS BECOME THE ORDER OF THE DAY BECOMES VERY IMPORTANT OK\n",
      "943, eh/processed_videos/lcGVMOUVJ3E_3_49.mp4  AND THE OTHER CAN BE HOST TO ROUTER OR ROUTER TO HOST THERE CAN BE ONE OR MORE ROUTERS ONE I HAVE SHOWN THERE CAN BE MORE ROUTERS CONNECTED THERE CAN BE OTHER ROUTERS ALSO CONNECTED FOR EXAMPLE THERE IS ANOTHER ROUTER HERE\n",
      "944, eh/processed_videos/9hAZ5LSdQik_1_104.mp4  SO CLIENT SENDS A HELLO MESSAGE\n",
      "945, eh/processed_videos/Wnygf2DjHIg_4_70.mp4 THIS IS THE TYPICAL THING WHICH IS DONE\n",
      "946, eh/processed_videos/X8F1Ex6bUeU_6_134.mp4 SO MANY BYTES OF DATA WILL FINALLY GET TRANSMITTED BUT ULTIMATELY I WAS TRYING TO TRANSMIT ONLY 200 BYTES\n",
      "947, eh/processed_videos/oYjbOF5QcZ8_4_61.mp4 MEANS WITH EVERY PASSING DAY YOU CAN SAY SO IF YOU CANNOT SECURE THESE KIND OF DEVICES IN A VERY GOOD WAY THEN IT WILL BE VERY EASY FOR SOMEONE SOME ATTACKER TO PENETRATE INTO THAT KIND OF A SYSTEM RIGHT SO\n",
      "948, eh/processed_videos/37BFoKpn4xg_2_51.mp4 SO THIS IS PICTORIALLY WHAT I HAVE JUST NOW MENTIONED\n",
      "949, eh/processed_videos/cHG1a5-xX9A_2_69.mp4  HERE AN ACTIVE PARTICIPATION OF THE SIGNER IS NECESSARY DURING SIGNATURE VERIFICATION\n",
      "950, eh/processed_videos/m582hVNdFFk_2_67.mp4 THERE ARE JUST TWO ADDITIONAL THINGS WHICH ARE THERE IN UDP WHICH IP DOES NOT HAVE AT THE TRANSPORT LAYER LEVEL IT INCORPORATES A CHECKSUM TO VERIFY WHETHER THE UDP PACKET\n",
      "951, eh/processed_videos/n8VCzsv5gi4_1_153.mp4 SO INSTEAD OF SPECIFYING THIS AS A 16 BIT FIELD BECAUSE THE NUMBER OF BITS IN THE HEADER IS LIMITED IT USES A 13 BIT FIELD AND PUTS A RESTRICTION THAT OFFSET HAS TO BE A MULTIPLE OF 8 BITS OK\n",
      "952, eh/processed_videos/7sgoPJ2MDdA_2_94.mp4 SO I CAN COLLECT MY PACKETS AT A FASTER RATE STORE IN A BUFFER AND THEN SLOWLY AND SLOWLY I WILL SEND IT TO THE OUTGOING LINK WHICH HAS A SLOWER DATA RATE\n",
      "953, eh/processed_videos/lcGVMOUVJ3E_2_13.mp4  TCP IS CONNECTION ORIENTED UDP IS CONNECTION LESS\n",
      "954, eh/processed_videos/-tfNAI_PwwQ_1_112.mp4 NOW ABSENCE OF HELLO PACKET FOR CERTAIN TIME FOR 40 SECONDS OR SO THIS MAY LEAD THE ROUTER TO TAKE A DECISION OR A CONCLUSION THAT WELL THAT LINK IS CURRENTLY DOWN THAT OTHER ROUTER HAS FAILED OK\n",
      "955, eh/processed_videos/m582hVNdFFk_2_92.mp4 THIS IS HOW IT WORKS\n",
      "956, eh/processed_videos/U0Jts2z9MOc_2_37.mp4  AND ON BEHALF OF THE ATTACKER ALL THESE BOTNETS ARE WORKING\n",
      "957, eh/processed_videos/NgVD3tJN_44_2_138.mp4  BECAUSE YOU YOU CAN TAKE THE PUBLIC KEY OF THE OTHER PARTY WHEREVER HE IS ENCRYPT IT AND SEND IT TO THAT PERSON THAT PERSON CAN DECRYPT IT USING HIS OR HER OWN PRIVATE KEY\n",
      "958, eh/processed_videos/xMubwlXSJf8_2_42.mp4 THERE IS A SECOND MECHANISM YOU CAN HAVE RSA BASED AUTHENTICATION USING YOUR PRIVATE KEY OR THERE IS SOME SOMETHING CALLED A CHALLENGE RESPONSE\n",

      "964, eh/processed_videos/Wnygf2DjHIg_3_18.mp4 FIRST IS IT SHOULD BE SOMETHING WHICH SHOULD NOT BE TOO DIFFICULT TO EVALUATE IN TERMS OF THE CHALLENGE RESPONSE\n",

      "973, eh/processed_videos/xMubwlXSJf8_2_95.mp4  AND AND THE OTHER ONE ALSO ON THE HEADER PART BECAUSE YOU SEE THIS HEADER PART IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE SAY IF I AM THE INTRUDER AND I AM ABLE TO HACK INTO SOME ROUTER SO THAT I CAN CHANGE THE HEADERS\n",
      "974, eh/processed_videos/lcGVMOUVJ3E_3_88.mp4  AND IN THE ROUTING TABLE OF R 1 THERE WILL BE SOMETHING LIKE THIS IT SAYS AGAIN IF THE DESTINATION IS H 2 THEN I HAVE TO GO TO R 2\n",
      "975, eh/processed_videos/5kw-999agbo_1_8.mp4  IN THE PRESENT CONTEXT HOW WE VISUALIZE A HASH FUNCTION AS OKAY WELL WE VISUALIZE A HASH FUNCTION AS AS SOME KIND OF COMPUTATIONAL FUNCTION THAT CAN DETERMINE A HASH DIGEST H\n",
